## Prerequisites

2. **Firefox** installed with at least one profile
3. **LibreWolf** installed (see installation instructions below)
4. **Bash** shell (included with macOS)

## Installing LibreWolf

If you haven't installed LibreWolf yet:

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install --cask librewolf

# Or download from
# https://librewolf.net/
```

## Usage

### 1. Download the Scripts

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/firefox-to-librewolf-migration.git
cd firefox-to-librewolf-migration

# Or download the scripts directly
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/firefox-to-librewolf-migration/main/migrate.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/firefox-to-librewolf-migration/main/verify.sh

# Make them executable
chmod +x migrate.sh verify.sh
```

### 2. Close Firefox and LibreWolf

Before running the migration, make sure both browsers are completely closed:

```bash
# Check if they're running
ps aux | grep -E "(Firefox|LibreWolf)" | grep -v grep

# If they are, close them through the UI or:
killall Firefox
killall LibreWolf
```

### 3. Run the Migration

```bash
./migrate.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect your Firefox profiles
- Let you choose which profile to migrate (if you have multiple)
- Create a backup of your current LibreWolf profiles
- Copy all data from Firefox to a new LibreWolf profile
- Update LibreWolf's configuration to recognize the new profile

### 4. Verify the Migration

```bash
./verify.sh
```

This will check that all important files were copied successfully.

### 5. Launch LibreWolf

After migration:
1. Open LibreWolf
2. If prompted, select the "Firefox Migrated" profile
3. Verify your bookmarks, passwords, and extensions are present
4. Sign into Firefox Sync if you use it (note: LibreWolf may have Sync disabled by default)

## File Structure

After migration, you'll find:

```
~/Desktop/Firefox-to-LibreWolf-Migration-[timestamp]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LibreWolf-Profiles-Backup/    # Backup of your original LibreWolf profiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ librewolf-profiles.ini.backup # Backup of LibreWolf's profile configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migration-report.txt          # Detailed report of what was migrated

~/Library/Application Support/librewolf/Profiles/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ firefox-migrated-[timestamp]/ # Your migrated Firefox profile
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Firefox/LibreWolf is running"
Make sure to completely quit both browsers before running the migration.

### Extensions not working
Some Firefox-specific extensions may need to be reinstalled from the LibreWolf add-ons store.

### Missing passwords
Ensure you migrate the profile that actually contains your saved passwords. You can check in Firefox under Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Saved Logins.

### Profile not showing in LibreWolf
Try launching LibreWolf with the profile manager:
```bash
librewolf -ProfileManager
```

## Reverting the Migration

Your Firefox data is never modified, so you can always go back to using Firefox.

To restore LibreWolf to its pre-migration state:
1. Close LibreWolf
2. Copy back the backup from `~/Desktop/Firefox-to-LibreWolf-Migration-*/LibreWolf-Profiles-Backup/`
3. Restore the original `profiles.ini` from the backup

## Privacy Notes

LibreWolf has enhanced privacy settings compared to Firefox:
- Resist fingerprinting is enabled by default
- Some features like Pocket and Sync may be disabled
- Telemetry is completely disabled
- DRM content may be disabled by default

These can be adjusted in LibreWolf's settings if needed.
